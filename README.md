# Directory_Bruter, 

**The aim of this python script**, _@author Emre | github.com/emreYbs_, is **to get the leftover development files, debugging scripts and configutations files in the server**.

So maybe, we can get some sensitive information by hunting common filenames and directories. 
Therefore, we can get some precaution for the leftovers.

**Important Note**:

-You should write the name of the target website like this: https://wwww.website.com  If you just provide it as "www.website.com", then you'll get an error.

-The wordlist(SVNDigger) I used can be downloaded here: https://www.netsparker.com/s/research/SVNDigger.zip

-You need to provide the downloaded wordlist path. In the code I wrote, I assumed the path "desktop".

- You can get the connection errors as response code and the URL **(or if the connection is successful (status 200) )** I've added some of my example screenshots and blurred the target website addresses. You can view the screenshots before running the code to get an idea.
